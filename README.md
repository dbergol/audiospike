****************************************************************************

The source code archive of AudioSpike contains all source code files and
C++-Builder project files (*.cbproj) to compile all executables and libraries
of AudioSpike. If not stated differently in separate _README.txt files within 
a projects subdirectory all projects were compiled using Embarcadero C++-Builder
11.3 Alexandria Professional. They were compiled using "Steema TChart Pro". The Pro
version is needed for histograms and calculation functions used within AudioSpike, 
compiling with the using "Steema TChart Standard" shipped with C++-Builder will fail.
You might need to adjust paths and/or 3rd party source code files and/or libraries 
within the project files for a successful build. 


Please extract the Development-directory conained in the archive to the installation 
directory of AudioSpike and read the contained _README.txt carefully
